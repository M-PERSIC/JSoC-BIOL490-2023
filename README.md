2. Use the trainee's name as the name of the repo2. Copy this file to somewhere to keep track of the instructions
   (or make note of the [template repo](https://github.com/Klepac-Ceraj-Lab/TraineeTemplate)).
3. Rename the `README_TEMPLATE.md` file to README.md
   and follow the instructions contained within.
